### Spring Boot REST API for Student Management

This API allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete student records, each of which consists of a student name and an address. It is built using Spring Boot, an open-source framework for creating stand-alone Java applications.

To use this API, you can send HTTP requests to the following endpoints:

* POST /students: creates a new student record with the given name and address in the request body.
* GET /students/{id}: retrieves the student record with the given ID.
* PUT /students/{id}: updates the student record with the given ID using the name and address in the request body.
* DELETE /students/{id}: deletes the student record with the given ID.
You can also use the API to list all student records by sending a GET request to /students.

This API is intended to be used with a React frontend application, which can make HTTP requests to the API endpoints to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the student records.

Here is a possible description for a React frontend application that implements the above Spring Boot REST API:

Student Management Frontend with React

This is a single-page web application built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to view, create, edit, and delete student records, using the Spring Boot REST API described above.

The application has the following features:

A form for entering a student's name and address, and creating a new student record.
A list of all student records, with each record showing the student's name and address.
The ability to edit or delete a student record by clicking on it in the list.
To run this application, you will need to have Node.js and npm (the Node.js package manager) installed on your computer. Then, you can clone the repository, install the dependencies with npm install, and start the development server with npm start.
